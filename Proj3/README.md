# 4370-6370-Project-Two-w-SBT
CSCI 4370 Fall 2016 Project 3

The charts which compare the performance of our select and join implementations
using various index data structures are located under the Charts directory. The
data from the simulations run to test our implementation are contained in the
Data directory. This project corrects various implementation mistakes from
project two as well as quantifies the performance of those implementations.
Thanks!
